## Description

PlotTwist is a social media platform where registered users may share posts containing text and images with other users. Users can interact with existing posts through reactions and comments, and they can edit and delete any post they have created themselves. Users may visit and edit their own profile page in order to express themselves how they like. They may also visit other users profile pages. Users may follow and unfollow other profiles, and they may see who follows them. The project focuses on design and frontend development.

## To sum up the steps of the project

The steps of the project is a reflection of experience learned over the last two years. Any relevant files (competitor research, personas, style tile, report ..) can be found under assets in this repo.

### Planning

This project stretched over 7 weeks, meaning that planning has been an important factor for ensuring that nothing is forgotten along the way, and that enough time is left at the end to finish up and gather all of the resources that makes up the entirety of the project. I used Trello for my day-to-day planning, and a Gannt chart to ensure that I was on track overall as we were moving towards to deadline.

### Design

As part of planning my design, I delved into some competitor research to see what trends and gaps I could find within the social media market. I then created personas and a style tile for myself, to help guide me through the rest of the design process. I created a prototype, did some user testing, updated my design and eventually ended up with a set of finished sketches that I could base my finished project on.

### Code

Finally I built the site. Initially, I focused on making sure my api requests came through correcly, getting familiar with the api and documentation. I have used Postman and the browser's dev tools a lot through this project to ensure I understand any error that pops up. Once I could see that the main content was coming through, I went on to look at comments, reactions, avatars, banners, tags and other parts of the api that required a little extra attention in order to work correctly. Finally, I added styling, tweaking and changing the layout and design where relevant.
