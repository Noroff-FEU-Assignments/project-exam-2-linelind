## Description

The following project is a social media platform where registered users can log in to view and share posts with other registered users. Users can interact with existing posts through reactions and comments, and they can edit and delete any post they have created themselves. Users may visit and edit their own profile page in order to express themselves how they like, and they may also visit other users profile pages. Users may follow and unfollow other profiles, and they may see who follows them. The project focuses on design and frontend development.
